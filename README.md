PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open source framework written in Java, that makes it easy to write complex
software for power systemsâ€™ simulations and analysis. Its modular approach allows developers to extend or customize its
features.

PowSyBl is part of the LF Energy Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects
within the energy and electricity sectors.

## PowSyBl vs PowSyBl Dev Tools

PowSyBl Dev Tools are components meant solely for debugging various PowSyBl components - in particular for [PowSyBl Single Line Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-single-line-diagram).

## PowSyBl diagram-viewer Dev Tool
PowSyBl diagram-viewer Dev Tool is a JavaFX basic viewer used to display:
* the single line diagrams generated by [PowSyBl Single Line Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-single-line-diagram)
* the area diagrams generated by [PowSyBl Network Area Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-network-area-diagram).

### Launching the viewer
- First install 
  - [powsybl-single-line-diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-single-line-diagram) latest SNAPSHOT version (clone the repo then `mvn clean install` on `main` branch)
  - [powsybl-network-area-diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-network-area-diagram) latest SNAPSHOT version (clone the repo then `mvn clean install` on `main` branch)
- Then launch the viewer by running
  ```
  mvn javafx:run
  ```
- Select the file you want to import in the viewer
- Once the file is imported, select the substation or the voltage level you want to display; you should obtain something similar to the following screenshot:

**Note**: alternatively, you can launch the viewer by running `DiagramViewer::main` with your favorite IDE.
Then you would need to:
* install [JavaFX 17](https://openjfx.io/) or above
* add the following vm options in the launch configuration:
  ```
  --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.web
  ```


## PowSyBl single-line-diagram-viewer Dev Tool
Not to be confused with JavaScript viewer [powsybl-single-line-diagram-viewer](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-single-line-diagram-viewer)!

PowSyBl single-line-diagram-viewer Dev Tool is a JavaFX basic viewer used to display the single line diagrams generated by [PowSyBl Single Line Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-single-line-diagram).

### Launching the viewer
- First install [powsybl-single-line-diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-single-line-diagram) latest SNAPSHOT version (clone the repo then `mvn clean install` on `main` branch)
- Then launch the viewer by running 
  ```
  mvn javafx:run
  ```
- Select the file you want to import in the viewer
- Once the file is imported, select the substation or the voltage level you want to display; you should obtain something similar to the following screenshot:

![Viewer screenshot](.github/sldv-screenshot.png)

**Note**: alternatively, you can launch the viewer by running `SingleLineDiagramViewer::main` with your favorite IDE.
Then you would need to:
* install [JavaFX 17](https://openjfx.io/) or above
* add the following vm options in the launch configuration:
  ```
  --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.web
  ```

## PowSyBl network-area-diagram-viewer Dev Tool
PowSyBl network-area-diagram-viewer Dev Tool is a JavaFX basic viewer used to display the area diagrams generated by [PowSyBl Network Area Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-network-area-diagram).

### Launching the viewer
- First install [powsybl-network-area-diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-network-area-diagram) latest SNAPSHOT version (clone the repo then `mvn clean install` on `main` branch)
- Then launch the viewer by running
  ```
  mvn javafx:run
  ```
- Select the file you want to import in the viewer
- Once the file is imported, select the voltage level and the depth to see the area around that voltage level; you should obtain something similar to the following screenshot:

![Viewer screenshot](.github/nadv-screenshot.png)

**Note**: again, you can alternatively launch the viewer by running `NetworkAreaDiagramViewer::main` with your favorite IDE.
Then you would need to:
* install [JavaFX 17](https://openjfx.io/) or above
* add the following vm options in the launch configuration:
  ```
  --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.web
  ```
