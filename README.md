PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open source framework written in Java, that makes it easy to write complex
software for power systemsâ€™ simulations and analysis. Its modular approach allows developers to extend or customize its
features.

PowSyBl is part of the LF Energy Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects
within the energy and electricity sectors.

## PowSyBl vs PowSyBl Dev Tools

PowSyBl Dev Tools are components meant solely for debugging various PowSyBl components - in particular for [Single Line Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-diagram/tree/main/single-line-diagram) and [Network Area Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-diagram/tree/main/network-area-diagram).

## PowSyBl diagram-viewer Dev Tool
PowSyBl diagram-viewer Dev Tool is a JavaFX basic viewer used to display:
* the single line diagrams generated by [Single Line Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-diagram/tree/main/single-line-diagram)
* the area diagrams generated by [Network Area Diagram](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-diagram/tree/main/network-area-diagram).

### Getting started
- Go to the diagram-viewer directory:
  ```
  cd /path/to/diagram-viewer
  ```
- Launch the viewer by running
  ```
  mvn javafx:run
  ```
- Select the file you want to import in the viewer
- Once the file is imported, select the substation or the voltage level you want to display; you should obtain something similar to the following screenshot:

**Note**: alternatively, you can launch the viewer by running `DiagramViewer::main` with your favorite IDE.
To do that you need to:
* install [JavaFX 17](https://openjfx.io/) or above
* add the following vm options in the launch configuration:
  ```
  --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.web
  ```
